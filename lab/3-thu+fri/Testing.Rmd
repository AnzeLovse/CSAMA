Go through [the Modern Statistics for Modern Biology book chapter on testing](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/Chap-Testing.html) and answer the questions. Re-run the code, check whether you can reproduce the figures and follow what is being done. You should be able to copy and paste code from that website, [a file with all the code is also available here](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/code).
